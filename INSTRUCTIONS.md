**Name:** **timecraft: Your Terminal's Time Machine**  
**Tagline:** *"Unearth patterns, fix mistakes, and laugh at your past self—all by mining your command history."*  

---

### **Core Concept**  
A CLI tool that analyzes your shell `history` to surface insights, automate repetitive workflows, and add humor to your terminal grind. Think of it as a mix of *"GitHub Copilot for your habits"* and *"A snarky diary of your CLI sins."*  

---

### **Key Features**  
1. **Command Archaeology**  
   - **Frequent Flyer Report**:  
     ```bash  
     timecraft stats --top-commands  
     # → "🔥 Your top 3 commands:  
     #    1. `git push` (127x)   → Alias candidate: `gp='git push'`  
     #    2. `npm run dev` (89x) → Auto-start when entering project dir?  
     #    3. `sudo !!` (42x)     😬 'Frequent sudoer' badge unlocked!"  
     ```  
   - **Typos Shame Log**:  
     ```bash  
     timecraft audit --typos  
     # → "🔍 You typed `sl` 15x instead of `ls`. Train with `timecraft drill ls`?"  
     ```  

2. **Auto-Alias Generator**  
   - Detects repetitive commands and suggests shortcuts:  
     ```bash  
     timecraft optimize  
     # → "⏩ We recommend adding to ~/.zshrc:  
     #    alias gacp='git add . && git commit -m "quick" && git push'"  
     ```  

3. **Danger Zone Alerts**  
   - Flags risky habits:  
     ```bash  
     timecraft audit --danger  
     # → "🚨 You ran `rm -rf *` 8x in ~/projects. Try `trash` instead?  
     #     → 'YOLO Dev' trophy revoked. Safety first!"  
     ```  

4. **Session Rewind**  
   - Replay a past terminal session:  
     ```bash  
     timecraft replay 2023-10-05  
     # → Simulates typing commands from that day with ASCII animation.  
     ```  

5. **Fun Retrospectives**  
   - Generate quirky stats:  
     ```bash  
     timecraft funfacts  
     # → "📜 You’ve typed `curl` 56x but only 3 URLs were unique.  
     #     🕒 Longest gap between breaks: 4h37m (on Tue). Hero mode!"  
     ```

### **Sample Workflow**  
```bash  
# After a coding sprint, check your habits  
timecraft stats --daily  

# Output:  
# 📅 2023-10-10  
# ──────────────  
# Commands: 217  
# Top tools: git (38%), npm (22%), ssh (15%)  
# Procrastination score: 12% (9x `cat /dev/urandom`)  
# 🏆 Achievement: "Marathon Coder" (3h uninterrupted)  


# Automate your most-used command chain  
timecraft optimize --auto  
# → Added alias `deploy_all='git pull && docker build && kubectl apply'`  
```

### **Why It’s Fun *and* Useful**  
- **Guilt-Free Gamification**: Earn badges like *"SSH Nomad"* (10 remote servers) or *"Watchdog"* (50x `ls` in a day).  
- **Productivity Guardrails**: Nudge you away from `rm -rf` and toward safer habits.  
- **Terminal Time Capsule**: Rewind to see how you debugged that gnarly bug last month.  

---

### **Tech Stack**  
- **rust** + **Textual** (for TUI)  
- **Fuzzy Matching** (for typo detection)  
- **Shell History Parsing** (zsh compatibility)  
- **Local Only** (no data leaves your machine)  

---

### **The Vibe**  
For developers who want to laugh at their `git` mishaps, optimize their flow, and never type `npm install` manually again.  

--- 

**Bonus**: Add `timecraft roast` for brutal honesty:  
```bash  
$ timecraft roast  
# → "You’ve run `vim`, `:q`, then `code .` 23x. Just admit you’re a VS Code poser. 😏"  
```  

Would this make your terminal history more entertaining—*and* make you a better developer? 🕵️‍♂️
